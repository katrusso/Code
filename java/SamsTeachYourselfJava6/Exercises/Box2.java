/*
	Constructors let you set initial values of instance vars, call methods based on those vars, call methods on other objects, 
	and set the initial properties of an object.

	Constructors ALWAYS have the same name as the class.
	They DO NOT have a return type.
	They CANNOT return a value in the method by using the return statement.

	If you have a constructor method that duplicates the behavior of an existing constructor you can call the first 
	constructor from inside the body of the second constructor:

	e.g. 

	class Circle {
		int x, y, radius;

		Circle(int xPoint, int yPoint, int radiusLength){
			this.x = xPoint;
			this.y = yPoint;
			this.radius = radiusLength;
		}

		Circle (int xPoint, int yPoint){
			this(xPoint, yPoint, 1);
		}
	}
